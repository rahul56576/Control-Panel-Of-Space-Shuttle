			<h4> The space shuttle's largest contribution was building the International Space Station, which remains in orbit today to conduct hundreds of science experiments annually on human health, engineering and other matters. The program is also remembered for launching and servicing the Hubble Space Telescope, visiting the Russian space station Mir, launching numerous satellites and probes, and performing thousands upon thousands of hours of basic science experiments.The Space Shuttle was the most complex space vehicle design of its time. It was comprised of four main
components: the External Tank (ET);
three Space Shuttle Main Engines;
two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs);
and the Orbiter vehicle. It was the
first side-mounted space system
dictated by the need to have a large
winged vehicle for cross-range
capability for re-entry into Earth’s
atmosphere and the ability to land a
heavyweight payload.
These four components provided the
shuttle with the ability to accomplish
a diverse set of missions over its
flight history. The Orbiter’s heavy
cargo/payload carrying capability, along
with the crew habitability and
flexibility to operate in space, made
this vehicle unique. Because of its lift
capability and due-East inclination, the
shuttle was able to launch a multitude
of satellites, Spacelab modules, science
platforms, interplanetary probes,
Department of Defense payloads, and
components/modules for the assembly
of the International Space Station (ISS).
The shuttle lift capability or payload
decreased with increased operational
altitude or orbit inclination because
more fuel was required to reach the
higher altitude or inclination.
Shuttle lift capability was also limited
by total vehicle landing weight—
different limits for different cases
(nominal or abort landing) 
The two SRBs provided the main
thrust to lift the shuttle off the launch
pad. Each booster provided about
14.7 meganewtons (3,300,000
pounds-force) of thrust at launch, and
they were only ignited once the three
main engines reached the required
104.5% thrust level for launch.
Once the SRBs were ignited, they
provided about 72% of the thrust
required of the entire shuttle at liftoff
and through the first stage, which
ended at SRB separation. After SRB separation, the main engines
provided the majority of thrust required
for the shuttle to reach orbital velocity.
Each main engine weighed about
3,200 kg (7,000 pounds). With a total
length of 4.3 m (14 ft), each engine,
operating at the 104.5% power level,
provided a thrust level of about 1.75
meganewtons (394,000 pounds-force)
at sea level and about 2.2 meganewtons
(492,000 pounds-force) at vacuum
throughout the entire 8 minutes and
30 seconds of powered flight. The
engine nozzle by itself was 2.9 m
(9.4 ft) long with a nozzle exit diameter
of 2.4 m (7.8 ft). Due to the high heat
generated by the engine thrust, each
engine contained 1,082 tubes throughout
its entire diameter, allowing circulation
of liquid hydrogen to cool the nozzle
during powered flight. The main
engines were a complex piece of
machinery comprised of high- and
low-pressure fuel and oxidizer pumps,
engine controllers, valves, etc. The
engines were under constant control
by the main engine controllers. These
consisted of an electronics package
mounted on each engine to control
engine operation under strict and critical
performance parameters. All components of the Space Shuttle
vehicle, except for the ET, were
designed to be reusable flight after
flight. The ET, once jettisoned from the
Orbiter, fell to Earth where atmospheric
heating caused the tank to break up
over the ocean.
The SRBs, once jettisoned from the
tank, parachuted back to the ocean
where they were recovered by special
ships and brought back to KSC.
With their solid propellant spent, the
boosters were de-stacked and shipped
back to aerospace and defense
company Thiokol in Utah for
refurbishment and reuse. The SRBs
were thoroughly inspected after every
mission to ensure that the components
were not damaged and could be
refurbished for another flight. Any
damage found was either repaired or
the component was discarded. The shuttle was
often used to deploy and retrieve
science experiments and satellites.
These science payloads were:
deployed using the Shuttle Robotic
Arm; allowed to conduct free-flight
scientific operations; and then
retrieved using the arm for return to
Earth for further data analysis. This
was a unique capability that only the
Orbiter could perform.
The Orbiter was also unique because
it was an extremely stable platform on
which to conduct microgravity research
studies in material, fundamental
physics, combustion science, crystal
growth, and biotechnology that required
minimal movement or disturbance from
the host vehicle. NASA studied the
effect of space adaptation on both
humans and animals. Crews of seven
worked around the clock conducting
research in these pressurized
modules/laboratories that were packed
with scientific equipment.
Much research was conducted with the
international community. The middeck was mostly the crew
accommodations area, and it housed
all the crew equipment required to
live and work in space. The middeck
also contained the three avionic bays
where the Orbiter electronic boxes
were installed. Due to their limited
power generation capability, the
Orbiter fuel cells consumables (power
generation cryogenics) provided
mission duration capability on the
order of about 12 to 14 days, dependent
on vehicle configuration.
In 2006, NASA put into place the
Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer
System, which allowed the ISS to
provide power to the Orbiter vehicle,
thereby allowing the Orbiter to
have a total mission duration of
about 16 days. </h4>
