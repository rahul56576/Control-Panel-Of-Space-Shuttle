		<h1> The Space Shuttle </h1>
	</div>
	<div class="op">
		<h4> The Space Shuttle design was remarkable. The idea of “wings in orbit”
took concrete shape in the brilliant minds of NASA engineers, and
the result was the most innovative, elegant, versatile, and highly
functional vehicle of its time. The shuttle was indeed an engineering
marvel on many counts. Accomplishing these feats required the design
of a very complex system.
In several ways, the shuttle combined unique attributes not witnessed
in spacecraft of an earlier era. The shuttle was capable of launching
like a rocket, reentering Earth’s atmosphere like a capsule, and
flying like a glider for a runway landing. It could rendezvous and
dock precisely, and serve as a platform for scientific research within
a range of disciplines that included biotechnology and radar
mapping. The shuttle also performed satellite launches and repairs,
bestowing an almost “perpetual youth” upon the Hubble Space
Telescope through refurbishments.
The most impressive product that resulted from the shuttle’s capabilities
and contributions is the International Space Station—a massive
engineering assembly and construction undertaking in space.
No other crewed spacecraft to date has replicated these capabilities.
The shuttle has left an indelible mark on our society and culture,
and will remain an icon of space exploration for decades to come. </h4>

		<h1> Space Shuttle Main Engines </h1>
	</div>
	<div class="ok">
		<h4> After SRB separation, the main engines
provided the majority of thrust required
for the shuttle to reach orbital velocity.
Each main engine weighed about
3,200 kg (7,000 pounds). With a total
length of 4.3 m (14 ft), each engine,
operating at the 104.5% power level,
provided a thrust level of about 1.75
meganewtons (394,000 pounds-force)
at sea level and about 2.2 meganewtons
(492,000 pounds-force) at vacuum
throughout the entire 8 minutes and
30 seconds of powered flight. The
engine nozzle by itself was 2.9 m
(9.4 ft) long with a nozzle exit diameter
of 2.4 m (7.8 ft). Due to the high heat
generated by the engine thrust, each
engine contained 1,082 tubes throughout
its entire diameter, allowing circulation
of liquid hydrogen to cool the nozzle
during powered flight. The main
engines were a complex piece of
machinery comprised of high- and
low-pressure fuel and oxidizer pumps,
engine controllers, valves, etc. The
engines were under constant control
by the main engine controllers. These
consisted of an electronics package
mounted on each engine to control
engine operation under strict and critical
performance parameters. The engines
ran at 104.5% performance for much
of the entire operation, except when
they were throttled down to about

72% during first stage to preclude
having the vehicle exceed structural
limits during high dynamic pressure as
well as close to main engine shutdown
to preclude the vehicle from exceeding
3 gravitational force (3g) limits.
The only manual main engine control
capability available to the crew was
the manual throttle control, which
allowed the crew to decrease engine
performance from 104.5% to a level
of 72% if required for vehicle control.
The main engines had the capability
to gimbal about 10.5 degrees up and
down and 8.5 degrees to either side to
change the thrust direction required
for changes in trajectory parameters. </h4>

		<h1> Assembling the International Space Station </h1>
	</div>
	<div class="kl">
		<h4> The ISS Node 1/Unity module was
launched on STS-88 (1998), thus
beginning the assembly of the ISS,
which required a total of 36 shuttle
missions to assemble and provide
logistical support for ISS vehicle
operations. As of October 2010,
Discovery had flown 12 missions and
Atlantis and Endeavour had flown
11 missions to the ISS, with each
mission carrying 12,700 to 18,600 kg
(28,000 to 41,000 pounds) of cargo
in the cargo bay and another 3,000 to
4,000 kg (7,000 to 9,000 pounds) of
equipment stowed in the crew cabin.
The combined total of ISS structure,
logistics, crew, water, oxygen, nitrogen,
and avionics delivered to the station for
all shuttle visits totaled more than
603,300 kg (1,330,000 pounds). No
other launch vehicle in the world could
deliver these large 4.27-m- (14-ft)-
diameter by 15.24-m- (50-ft)-long
structures or have this much capability.
ISS missions required modifications
to the three vehicles cited above—
Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour—
to dock to the space station. The
docking requirement resulted in the
Orbiter internal airlock being moved
externally in the payload bay. This
change, along with the inclusion of the
docking mechanism, added about
1,500 kg (3,300 pounds) of mass to
the vehicle weight. </h4>

		<h1> A Platform for Scientific Research </h1>
	</div>
	<div class="rr">
		<h4> The Orbiter was configured to
accommodate many different types
of scientific equipment, ranging from
large pressurized modules called
Spacelab or Spacehab where the crew
conducted scientific research in a
shirt-sleeve environment to the radars
and telescopes for Earth mapping,
celestial observations, and the study
of solar, atmospheric, and space
plasma physics. The shuttle was
often used to deploy and retrieve
science experiments and satellites.
These science payloads were:
deployed using the Shuttle Robotic
Arm; allowed to conduct free-flight
scientific operations; and then
retrieved using the arm for return to
Earth for further data analysis. This
was a unique capability that only the
Orbiter could perform.
The Orbiter was also unique because
it was an extremely stable platform on
which to conduct microgravity research
studies in material, fundamental
physics, combustion science, crystal
growth, and biotechnology that required
minimal movement or disturbance from
the host vehicle. NASA studied the
effect of space adaptation on both
humans and animals. Crews of seven
worked around the clock conducting
research in these pressurized
modules/laboratories that were packed
with scientific equipment.
Much research was conducted with the
international community. These
missions brought together international
academic, industrial, and governmental partners to obtain maximum benefits
and results. The facilities included
middeck glove boxes for conducting
research and testing science procedures
and for developing new technologies in
microgravity. These boxes enabled
crew members to handle, transfer, and
manipulate experiment hardware and
material that were not approved for use
in the shuttle. There were furnaces to
study diffusion, and combustion
modules for conducting research on the
single most important chemical process
in our everyday lives. The shuttle had
freezers for sample return as well as the

Memories of Wonder
“We have arrived at the base of the launch pad, dressed
for the occasion in bright orange pressure suits that fit
worse than they look. This is the day! As we enter the
service elevator that will take us 193 feet up to the level
of the shuttle cabin, we get to appreciate the size of this
ship, the mighty solid rockets that hold the gargantuan
External Tank and the seemingly fragile shuttle craft, poised
on this unlikely contraption like a gigantic moth, gathering
strength, for she knows full well where she is going today.
One by one, between nervous smiles and sheer anticipation,
we climb into our ship, aided by expert technicians who
execute their tasks with seamless and clockwork precision,
while soothing our minds with carefree conversation.
The chatter over the audio channels reverberates,
unemotional, precise, relentless, and the countdown
clock is our master. We often say that, on launch day, the
ship seems alive, hissing and creaking with the flow of
the super-cold fluids that give her life. Over the course of
3 hours, waiting patiently for the hour of deliverance,
we have each become one with the Orbiter. The chatter has
subsided, the technicians have gone. It is just us now, our
orange cocoons securely strapped and drawing the sap of
the mother ship through multiple hoses and cables. It feels
cozy and safe, alas, our comfort is tempered by the
knowledge of the machine and the job we are about to do.
‘GLS is go for main engine start…’ sounds the familiar
female voice. The rumbling below signals the beginning of
an earthquake. We feel a sudden jolt, the ship is free and
she flies! We feel the shaking and vibration and the onset of
the ‘g’ forces that build up uncomfortably, squeezing our
chests and immobilizing our limbs as the craft escapes the
pull of the Earth. And in less than 9 minutes, we are in space.
The view is the most beautiful thing we ever saw and we will
see this over and over from what is now our new home in the
vacuum of space. The days will pass and this extraordinary
vehicle will carry us to our destination…to our destiny.
It has learned to dance in space, with exquisite precision and
grace, first alone, then with other lonely dates, the Hubble
telescope, the Russian Mir station and the International
Space Station, and when the job was done, it returned to land
softly, majestically, triumphant…and ready to do it all again.”
capability to store large amounts of
data for further analysis back on Earth.
Scientists used spin tables to conduct
biological and physiological research
on the crew members.
The Orbiter provided all the power
and active cooling for the laboratories.
A typical Spacelab was provided
approximately 6.3 kW (8.45 hp)
of power, with peak power as high
as 8.1 kW (10.86 hp). To cool the
laboratories’ electronics, the modules
were tied into the Orbiter’s cooling
system so thermal control of the
payload was the same as thermal
control for the Orbiter avionics.
In an effort to share this national
resource with industry and academia,
NASA developed the Get Away
Special Program, designed to provide
inexpensive access to space for both
novices and professionals to explore
new concepts at little risk. In total,
over 100 Get Away Special payloads
were flown aboard the shuttle, and
each payload often consisted of
several individual experiments.
The cylindrical payload canisters in
which these experiments were flown
measured 0.91 m (3 ft) in length with
a 0.46-m (1.5-ft) diameter. They were
integrated into the Orbiter cargo bay
on the sill/sidewall and required
minimal space and cargo integration
engineering. The experiments could
be confined inside a sealed canister, or
the canister could be configured with a
lid that could be opened for experiment
pointing or deployment.
The shuttle was also an extremely
accurate platform for precise pointing
of scientific payloads at the Earth and
celestial targets. These unpressurized
payloads were also integrated into
the cargo bay; however, unlike the
Spacelab and Spacehab science
modules, these payloads were not
accessible by the crew, but rather were
exposed to the space environment.
The crew activated and operated these
experiments from the pressurized
confines of the Orbiter flight deck.
The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
was dedicated to mapping the Earth’s
topography between 60° North and
58° South, including the ocean floor.
The result of the mission was a threedimensional digital terrain map of
90% of the Earth’s surface. The Orbiter
provided about 10 kW (13.4 hp) of
power to the Shuttle Radar Topography
Mission payload during on-orbit
operations and all of the cooling for the
payloads’ electronics. </h4>

		<h1> Processing the Shuttle for Flight </h1>
	</div>
	<div class="an">
		<h4> When taking a road trip, it is important to plan ahead by making sure
your vehicle is prepared for the journey. A typical road trip on Earth can be
routine and simple. The roadways are already properly paved, service
stations are available if vehicle repairs are needed, and food, lodging, and
stores for other supplies can also be found. The same, however, could not be
said for a Space Shuttle trip into space. The difficulties associated with
space travel are complex compared with those we face when traveling here.
Food, lodging, supplies, and repair equipment must be provided for within
the space vehicle.
Vehicle preparation required a large amount of effort to restore the shuttle
to nearly new condition each time it flew. Since it was a reusable vehicle
with high technical performance requirements, processing involved a
tremendous amount of “hands-on” labor; no simple tune-up here. Not only
was the shuttle’s exterior checked and repaired for its next flight, all
components and systems within the vehicle were individually inspected and
verified to be functioning correctly. This much detail work was necessary
because a successful flight was dependent on proper vehicle assembly.
During a launch attempt, decisions were made within milliseconds by
equipment and systems that had to perform accurately the first time—there
was no room for hesitation or error. It has been said that a million things
have to go right for the launch, mission, and landing to be a success, but it
can take only one thing to go wrong for them to become a failure.
In addition to technical problems that could plague missions, weather
conditions also significantly affected launch or landing attempts. Unlike our
car, which can continue its road trip in cloudy, windy, rainy, or cold weather
conditions, shuttle launch and landing attempts were restricted to occur only
during optimal weather conditions. As a result, weather conditions often
caused launch delays or postponed landings.
Space Shuttle launches were a national effort. During the lengthy
processing procedures for each launch, a dedicated workforce of support
staff, technicians, inspectors, engineers, and managers from across
the nation at multiple government centers had to pull together to ensure
a safe flight. The whole NASA team performed in unison during shuttle
processing, with pride and dedication to its work, to make certain the
success of each mission. </h4>
